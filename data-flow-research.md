# Micro Frontend Data Flow Research

This document explores different approaches for data transfer between micro frontend applications, specifically focusing on communication between React and Angular applications.

## Custom Events (Window Events) - Keep because:
- Already in use in your system
- Simple implementation
- Works well with your current setup

## Redux/NgRx with Module Federation - Keep because:
- You already have Module Federation configured
- Good for complex state management
- Works well between React and Angular

## Shared Library Approach - Keep because:
- Works well with Module Federation
- Provides type safety
- Good for React-Angular integration

## WebSocket Communication - Keep as an option because:
- Could be useful if you need real-time updates
- Good fallback for cross-origin communication
- Scalable solution if needs grow

## Other Approaches:
### Web Storage with Storage Events
- Pros
- Built-in persistence
- Simple implementation
- Cross-tab communication
- Cons
- Storage size limits
- String-only storage
- Performance issues with large datasets
- Same-origin restriction
- Synchronous API

### MessageChannel API
- Primarily designed for iframe communication

### Between Main App and React Remote
Use Shared Library approach with Module Federation:

- Direct component integration
- Type-safe data transfer
- Efficient communication
### Between Main App and Angular Remote
Use Custom Events for iframe communication:

- Simple implementation
- Good iframe compatibility
- Lightweight solution
This combination provides:

- Type safety where possible
- Simple event-based communication for iframes
- Unified API for both remote apps
- Scalability for future extensions
- Good debugging capabilities
