# Micro Frontend Data Flow Research

This document explores different approaches for data transfer between micro frontend applications, specifically focusing on communication between React and Angular applications.

## 1. Custom Events (Window Events)

### Implementation
```javascript
// Sending data
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('csvData', { 
  detail: { data: csvContent } 
}));

// Receiving data
window.addEventListener('csvData', (event) => {
  const data = event.detail;
});
### Pros
- Simple implementation
- No external dependencies
- Works well with iframes
- Lightweight solution
- Real-time communication
- Good browser support
### Cons
- Limited by same-origin policy
- No built-in error handling
- Can become complex with multiple events
- Debugging challenges
- No type safety by default
- No persistence

## 2. Redux/NgRx with Module Federation
### Implementation

// Shared store configuration
const store = createStore({
  csvData: {
    react: null,
    angular: null
  }
});

### Pros
- Centralized state management
- Predictable data flow
- Excellent debugging capabilities
- Type safety support
- Time-travel debugging
- Middleware support
### Cons
- Increased bundle size
- Complex setup
- Learning curve
- Potential version conflicts
- Overhead for simple applications
## 3. BroadcastChannel API
### Implementation
const channel = new BroadcastChannel('csv_data');
channel.postMessage(data);
channel.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = event.data;
};

### Pros
- Purpose-built for cross-window communication
- Clean API
- Good performance
- Works across tabs/windows
- Real-time updates
### Cons
- Limited browser support
- Same-origin restriction
- No data persistence
- No built-in error handling
- Limited type safety
## 4. Web Storage with Storage Events
### Implementation
// Sending
localStorage.setItem('csvData', JSON.stringify(data));

// Receiving
window.addEventListener('storage', (e) => {
  if (e.key === 'csvData') {
    const data = JSON.parse(e.newValue);
  }
});

### Pros
- Built-in persistence
- Simple implementation
- Cross-tab communication
- Excellent browser support
- No external dependencies
### Cons
- Storage size limits
- String-only storage
- Performance issues with large datasets
- Same-origin restriction
- Synchronous API
## 5. Shared Library Approach
### Implementation
```
interface CSVData {
  source: 'react' | 'angular';
  data: any[];
}

class SharedDataService {
  private static instance: SharedDataService;
  private data = new Map<string, CSVData>();
  
  static getInstance() {
    return this.instance || (this.instance = new SharedDataService());
  }
  
  setData(key: string, data: CSVData) {
    this.data.set(key, data);
    this.notifyListeners(key, data);
  }
}
```
### Pros
- Type safety across applications
- Centralized data management
- Easy maintenance
- Better testing capabilities
- Module Federation compatible
- Clear data flow
### Cons
- Initial setup complexity
- Shared dependency management
- Version control challenges
- Build configuration requirements
## 6. WebSocket Communication
### Implementation
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');
socket.send(JSON.stringify(data));
socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
};

### Pros
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- Scale well for multiple clients
- Built for real-time updates
- Cross-origin support
- Efficient for frequent updates
### Cons
- Server infrastructure required
- Connection management overhead
- More complex implementation
- Potential reconnection handling
- Additional hosting costs
## Recommended Approach for This Project
For the current micro frontend architecture with React and Angular applications, a hybrid approach is recommended:

For the current micro frontend architecture with React and Angular applications, a hybrid approach is recommended:

### Between Main App and React Remote
Use Shared Library approach with Module Federation:

- Direct component integration
- Type-safe data transfer
- Efficient communication
### Between Main App and Angular Remote
Use Custom Events for iframe communication:

- Simple implementation
- Good iframe compatibility
- Lightweight solution
This combination provides:

- Type safety where possible
- Simple event-based communication for iframes
- Unified API for both remote apps
- Scalability for future extensions
- Good debugging capabilities
