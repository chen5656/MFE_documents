# Why Not Iframe in Micro-Frontend Architecture

While iframe provides a native browser isolation mechanism for micro-frontends, it comes with several significant drawbacks that make it less ideal for modern web applications.

## 1. URL Management Issues
- Browser history management doesn't work properly
  - Back/forward buttons don't function as expected
  - URL state is lost upon page refresh
  - Deep linking becomes problematic
- Poor user experience in terms of navigation

## 2. Performance Concerns
- Each iframe creates a new browser context
  - Complete reload of resources for each iframe
  - Increased memory consumption
  - Higher CPU usage
- Slower initial loading times
  - Separate HTTP requests for each iframe
  - Duplicate resource loading
  - Additional DOM elements

## 3. UI/UX Limitations
- Challenging layout management
  - Difficulty in creating responsive designs
  - Modal dialogs and overlays don't work well across iframe boundaries
  - Cannot achieve seamless UI integration
- Styling inconsistencies
  - CSS isolation makes it difficult to maintain consistent themes
  - Complex to implement dynamic resize handling
  - Z-index stacking context issues

## 4. Communication Complexity
- Limited data sharing capabilities
  - No direct access to parent/child window objects
  - Complex postMessage implementation required
  - Increased development overhead
- Authentication challenges
  - Cookie sharing issues across different domains
  - Complex SSO implementation
  - Session management complications

## Conclusion
While iframes offer strong isolation, the numerous limitations in terms of performance, user experience, and development complexity make them unsuitable for modern micro-frontend architectures. Modern solutions like Module Federation, Single-SPA, or custom JavaScript solutions provide better alternatives with fewer drawbacks.


## Better alternatives:

1. Web Components :
   - Angular components can be exported as Web Components
   - Can be directly used in React
   - Example modification:
```typescriptreact
// ... existing code ...
<div className="remote-app angular-app">
  <h2>Angular Remote App</h2>
  <angular-csv-viewer></angular-csv-viewer>
</div>
// ... existing code ...
 ```

2. Custom Elements :
   
   - Angular provides @angular/elements package
   - Convert Angular components into custom elements
   - Better integration with React
3. Single-SPA Framework :
   
   - Dedicated micro-frontend framework
   - Proper lifecycle management
   - Better routing integration
   - Shared state management
4. Module Federation with Angular Elements :
   
   - Combine Webpack Module Federation with Angular Elements
   - Better bundle optimization
   - Runtime integration without iframes
